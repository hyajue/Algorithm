/**
* Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
* 
* Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
* 
* Note:
* You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
* 
* Follow up:
* A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
* First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
* 
* Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

复杂度
时间：O(n) 空间O(1)

思路：三路快排
Using 3-way quick sort to achieve one-pass algo
pick '1' as pivot:
[less than 1, ==1, bigger than 1] 

index counting sort is also a solution, which can be used in many other questions.
